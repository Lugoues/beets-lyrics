Hello!

This is a test plugin for the beets music managment system. The engines module was borrowed from the lrcShow-X project [https://code.launchpad.net/lrcshow-x]. 

Configuration:
You can add '[Lyrics]' to your beetsconfig file now with two options 

force: will force all updates all the time ( True, False)
engines: space deliminated list of engines you wish to search (Defaults to all engines). Order will determine priority
    Available Engines:  ailrc, ALSong, baidu, cmdi, evillyrics, google, lrcdb, lyrdb, miniLyrics, sogou, ttPlayer, winampcn, youdao
processes: number of consecutive files to tag


ToDo:
 - Add UI to allow users to compare old lyrics w/ new lyrics before updating
